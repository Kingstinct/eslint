# @eslint-config-kingstinct

![CI Status](https://github.com/kingstinct/eslint/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

## Principles

1. As many autofixable rules as possible, because enforcing standards that don't require extra developer effort is (almost) always a good idea.
2. Don't error on non-fixable errors (that don't risk causing unforeseen errors).

If you see something that could be improved based on these principles, please submit a pull request! :)

## Usage

This is the base eslint config I use for React Native. It's based on the popular Airbnb-config with a few plugin additions:

* TypeScript
* import
* jest
* json
* react
* react-native

I've also made some minor changes to the rules, so if you've got other preferences you might want to override some rules. I highly recommend you to use eslint, flowtype with plugins for your texteditor/IDE.

The two main principles are to catch errors early on and to boost productivity (so for example I've disabled react/sort-comp as it's not fixed automatically yet).

* **Enforce [lodash-fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide)** instead of lodash.
  * **Why?** Many lodash methods are mutable which might cause hard-to-debug side effects, especially when using redux . With lodash-fp you're safe.
  * **Disable** if you really want to use the mutable lodash flavour (not recommended). Add this to your .eslintrc:

    ```
    { ...,
        rules: { ...,
          'lodash-fp/use-fp': 0
        }
    }
    ```

## Install

1. Install the correct versions of each package, which are listed by the command:

  ```sh
  npm info "eslint-config-kingstinct@latest" peerDependencies
  ```

  Linux/OSX users can run (if you're using NPM)

  ```sh
  (
    export PKG=eslint-config-kingstinct;
    npm info "$PKG@latest" peerDependencies --json | command sed 's/[\{\},]//g ; s/: /@/g' | xargs npm install --save-dev "$PKG@latest"
  )
  ```

  or (if you're using yarn)

  ```sh
  (
    export PKG=eslint-config-kingstinct;
    npm info "$PKG@latest" peerDependencies --json | command sed 's/[\{\},]//g ; s/: /@/g' | xargs yarn add --dev "$PKG@latest"
  )
  ```

  Which produces and runs a command like:

  ```sh
  npm install --save-dev eslint-config-kingstinct eslint@^#.#.# eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@^#.#.# eslint-plugin-import@^#.#.# eslint-plugin-react@^#.#.#
  ```

  Windows users can either install all the peer dependencies manually, or use the [install-peerdeps](https://github.com/nathanhleung/install-peerdeps) cli tool.

  ```sh
  npm install -g install-peerdeps
  install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-kingstinct
  ```

  The cli will produce and run a command like:

  ```sh
  npm install --save-dev eslint-config-kingstinct eslint@^#.#.# eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@^#.#.# eslint-plugin-import@^#.#.# eslint-plugin-react@^#.#.#
  ```

2. Add `"extends": "eslint-config-kingstinct"` to your .eslintrc (or eslint-config-kingstinct/react or eslint-config-kingstinct/react-native depending on your environment)

## Running tests

You can run tests with `npm test`. It will run the lint config on the project itself.

## Contributing

Let's try to keep general rules in `base.js`, general react rules in `react.js` and react-native specific rules in `react-native.js`
